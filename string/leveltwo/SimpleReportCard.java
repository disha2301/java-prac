/*Create a program to take input marks of students in 3 subjects physics, chemistry, and maths. Compute the percentage and then calculate the grade as shown in figure below

Hint => 
Write a method to generate random 2-digit scores for Physics, Chemistry and Math (PCM) for the students and return the scores. This method returns a 2D array with PCM scores for all students
Write a Method to calculate the total, average, and percentages for each student and return a 2D array with the corresponding values. Please ensure to round off the values to 2 Digits using Math.round() method
Write a Method to calculate the grade based on the percentage as shown in the ref table and return a 2D array of students' grade
Finally write a Method to display the scorecard of all students with their scores, total, average, percentage, and grade in a tabular format.
